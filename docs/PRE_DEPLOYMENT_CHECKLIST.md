    -f infrastructure/Dockerfile \
    --load \
    .
  ```

- [ ] **Verify build succeeded**
  - Check for "Successfully built" message
  - No errors in build output

  docker run -d -p 8181:80 ryakel/flight-budget:dev
  # Test in browser, then cleanup
  docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=ryakel/flight-budget:dev)
  ```

#### Step 2: Test Main Build with Versioning

- [ ] **Create test commit on main**
  ```bash
  git checkout main

    - Version tag (e.g., `v0.0.1`)
  - Both should show 3 platforms

- [ ] **Check Docker Hub description**
  - Verify description matches README.md
  - Should be auto-synced

- [ ] **Pull and test latest image**
  ```bash
  docker pull ryakel/flight-budget:latest
  docker run -d -p 8181:80 ryakel/flight-budget:latest
  # Test in browser
  ```

#### Step 3: Test Dependency Update Workflow

- [ ] **Manually trigger workflow**

  - Watch workflow run
  - Should download libraries
  - Check if PR created (only if versions changed)

- [ ] **Verify library files**
  ```bash
  ls -lh app/libs/
  # Verify files exist and have reasonable sizes
  ```

- [ ] **Check VERSIONS.txt**
  ```bash
  cat app/libs/VERSIONS.txt
  # Should list all library versions
