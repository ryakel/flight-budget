# Stale Workflow Added

## Summary

The stale issues workflow has been successfully added to the Flight Budget Calculator repository, matching the configuration from your stream-harvestarr repository.

---

## What Was Added

### File: `.github/workflows/stale.yml`

**Purpose**: Automatically close inactive issues and pull requests to keep the repository clean and manageable.

**Configuration**:
- **Schedule**: Runs daily at 1:30 AM UTC
- **Permissions**: Issues, pull requests, and contents (write access)

---

## How It Works

### Issues
1. **After 30 days** of inactivity → Marked as `stale`
   - Comment added: "This issue is stale because it has been open 30 days with no activity. Remove stale label or comment or this will be closed in 5 days."

2. **After 5 more days** (35 total) → Issue closed
   - Comment added: "This issue was closed because it has been stalled for 5 days with no activity."

### Pull Requests
1. **After 45 days** of inactivity → Marked as `stale`
   - Comment added: "This PR is stale because it has been open 45 days with no activity. Remove stale label or comment or this will be closed in 10 days."

2. **After 10 more days** (55 total) → PR closed
   - Comment added: "This PR was closed because it has been stalled for 10 days with no activity."

---

## Exempt Labels

Issues or PRs with these labels will **never** be marked stale or closed:
- `awaiting-approval` - Items waiting for review
- `wip` - Work in progress

---

## How to Prevent Closure

If you want to keep an issue or PR open, you have several options:

### Option 1: Add a Comment
Any comment on the issue/PR resets the inactivity timer.

```
Example: "Still working on this, need more time to investigate."
```

### Option 2: Remove the Stale Label
Once the bot adds the `stale` label, you can manually remove it:
1. Go to the issue/PR
2. Click the `stale` label to remove it
3. Timer resets

### Option 3: Add an Exempt Label
Add one of the exempt labels:
- `awaiting-approval`
- `wip`

---

## Timeline Examples

### Issue Timeline
```
Day 0:  Issue opened
Day 15: Last comment/activity
Day 45: [30 days later] Marked stale + warning comment
Day 48: Someone adds comment → Stale label removed
Day 78: [30 days later] Marked stale again
Day 83: [5 days later] Issue closed
```

### Pull Request Timeline
```
Day 0:  PR opened
Day 10: Last commit/comment
Day 55: [45 days later] Marked stale + warning comment
Day 60: No activity
Day 65: [10 days later] PR closed
```

## Customization

If you need to adjust the timing, edit [`.github/workflows/stale.yml`](../.github/workflows/stale.yml):

### Change Stale Period
```yaml
days-before-issue-stale: 30   # Change to 60 for longer wait
days-before-pr-stale: 45      # Change to 90 for longer wait
```

### Change Close Period
```yaml
days-before-issue-close: 5    # Change to 14 for longer warning
days-before-pr-close: 10      # Change to 21 for longer warning
```

### Add More Exempt Labels
```yaml
exempt-issue-labels: 'awaiting-approval,wip,on-hold,blocked'
exempt-pr-labels: 'awaiting-approval,wip,on-hold,blocked'
```

### Change Schedule
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: "30 1 * * *"    # Daily at 1:30 AM UTC
  - cron: "0 0 * * 0"     # Weekly on Sunday at midnight UTC
  - cron: "0 0 1 * *"     # Monthly on 1st at midnight UTC
```

## Reopening Closed Items

If an issue or PR was closed by the stale bot but needs to be reopened:

1. **Reopen the issue/PR** (standard GitHub reopen)
2. **Add a comment** explaining why it's still relevant
3. **Add an exempt label** if it will take time to complete
4. **Remove stale label** if present

The bot will respect your manual intervention.
