# Dependabot configuration for Flight Budget Calculator
# Note: Dependabot cannot directly update vendored CDN libraries
# But it CAN:
# - Update GitHub Actions
# - Monitor Docker base images
# - Check for security vulnerabilities in vendored libraries (via security alerts)

version: 2
updates:
  # GitHub Actions - Keep workflows up to date
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "github-actions"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "ci"
      include: "scope"

  # Docker - Monitor base image updates (nginx:alpine)
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/infrastructure"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "docker"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore"
      include: "scope"

# For vendored JavaScript libraries (PapaParse, Chart.js, html2pdf.js):
# Dependabot CANNOT auto-update these because they're vendored CDN files.
#
# Our solution:
# 1. Manual updates via dependencies.json
# 2. GitHub Security Advisories will still alert on known vulnerabilities
# 3. Consider adding renovate bot for better CDN support (see docs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md)
