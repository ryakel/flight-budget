# Changelog

All notable changes to the Flight Budget Calculator are documented here.

## Latest Changes

### Automated Release System (2025-11-28)
- **Automatic releases on main branch merges**: Creates GitHub releases when PRs from develop are merged
- **Semantic versioning**: Automatic version bumping based on commit message conventions
  - `breaking:` or `major:` → Major version bump (x.0.0)
  - `feat:` or `feature:` → Minor version bump (0.x.0)
  - All other commits → Patch version bump (0.0.x)
- **Release notes generation**: Automatically extracts content from this changelog
- **Docker image tagging**: Images tagged with both `latest` and version number
- **Comprehensive release documentation**: Created [Release Process](Release-Process) guide

### FAA Lookup Bug Fixes & UX Improvements (2025-11-28)
- **Fixed API endpoint mismatch**: Updated health check to use `/tail-lookup-api/api/v1/health`
- **Fixed data source persistence**: Aircraft imported with FAA lookup now correctly save `source: 'faa'` property
- **Added data source badges**:
  - "✓ FAA Verified" badge (green) for FAA-sourced aircraft data
  - "ForeFlight" badge (blue) for ForeFlight CSV data
  - Badges display consistently in both CSV import modal and Manage Aircraft screen
- **Browser cache issue resolved**: Updated JavaScript correctly served after container rebuild
- **Example deployment configurations**:
  - `infrastructure/examples/docker-compose.basic.yml` - Simple deployment without FAA lookup
  - `infrastructure/examples/docker-compose.with-faa-lookup.yml` - Full deployment with tail-lookup
  - `infrastructure/examples/README.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation

### tail-lookup Integration (2025-11-28)
- **Integrated tail-lookup service** for FAA aircraft data verification
- **Lightweight Python + SQLite architecture** (256MB memory)
- Profile-based conditional deployment (`profiles: [faa-lookup]`)
- Internal networking only (`expose: ["8080"]`)
- Environment variables:
  - `ENABLE_FAA_LOOKUP` - Toggle FAA lookup feature
  - `TAIL_LOOKUP_API_URL=http://tail-lookup:8080`
- Automatic daily FAA data updates via tail-lookup nightly builds
- Simpler service architecture with single lightweight container
- Verified working with local testing (N172SP, N55350)

### Build Performance Optimization (2025-11-28)
- **Parallelized multi-architecture builds** using GitHub Actions matrix strategy
- Split workflows into prepare, build (parallel), and merge jobs
- Build each platform separately using push-by-digest strategy
- Merge platform images into single multi-platform manifest
- Per-platform cache scoping for better efficiency
- Applied to: `docker-build.yml`, `docker-build-develop.yml`, `cron.yml`
- **Expected build time**: ~15 minutes (down from 45+ minutes, 3x speedup)

### Platform Support Changes (2025-11-28)
- **Dropped ARM v7 support** from all workflows (too slow, rarely used)
- Kept `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (most common platforms)
- Updated all documentation to remove arm/v7 references

## Features

### Aircraft Import UI Redesign
- Replaced single "Aircraft Name" field with separate fields for Tail Number, Year, Make, and Model
- Fields display in 2x2 grid with larger text boxes for easier editing
- All fields pre-fill from logbook CSV data
- Added purple gradient button styling matching app theme
- Dropdown format changed to `[TailNumber] Type` (e.g., `[N52440] Cessna P172 Skyhawk Powermatic`)

### Simulator Support
- Fixed AATD simulator not appearing in import list
- Simulator time properly tracked from `SimulatedFlight` column
- Simulator fields auto-populate: "N/A" for Year/Make, type for Model (e.g., "AATD Simulator")

### Set as Default Feature
- Added "★ Set as Default" button to aircraft management form
- Button appears when viewing a non-default aircraft
- Matches existing button styling (btn-secondary)
- Automatically hides when aircraft is already default
- Updates dropdown to show ★ indicator after setting default
- Added "★ Set as default aircraft" checkbox to CSV import modal
- First aircraft in import list is checked by default
- Only one aircraft can be marked as default at a time
- Default aircraft is set automatically during import

### FAA Aircraft Lookup (Self-Hosted via tail-lookup)
- Automatic aircraft details lookup from FAA Registry for US aircraft (N-numbers)
- **Fully self-contained** - runs entirely in your infrastructure with no external API dependencies
- **Conditional deployment** - Enable/disable via environment flag (`ENABLE_FAA_LOOKUP`)
- Self-hosted tail-lookup service runs as Docker sidecar container using Compose profiles
- **No CORS issues** - dynamically proxied through nginx at `/tail-lookup-api/`
- Profile-based conditional deployment
- Opt-in feature (disabled by default) with checkbox toggle in UI
- Only attempts lookup for tail numbers starting with 'N'
- Shows data source badges: "✓ FAA Verified" (green), "ForeFlight" (blue)
- 24-hour cache duration to improve performance and reduce API calls
- Graceful fallback to ForeFlight CSV data if lookup fails or is disabled
- JSON API integration - no HTML scraping required
- Three deployment modes: Basic (no lookup), with tail-lookup service
- Dynamic nginx configuration based on deployment mode
- Automated deployment script with automatic profile selection
- Full Portainer support with native profile integration
- Automated daily database updates via tail-lookup nightly builds
- Environment configuration template with feature flags
- Debug function available in console: `AircraftLookup.testLookup('N12345')`

## Bug Fixes

- **CSV Format**: Dynamic header row detection for ForeFlight format changes
- **Data Loss**: Fixed aircraft import modal clearing data before use
- **Year Field**: Fixed Year field data flow from CSV to UI
- **equipType Field**: Fixed simulator detection by checking both `equipType (FAA)` and `equipType` fields
- **Default Values**: Pre-filled rate fields with defaults ($150 wet, $120 dry, $6/gal, 8 gal/hr)
- **Duplicate IDs**: Added random component to ID generation
- **Name Formatting**: Removed "Aircraft" suffix and replaced "AICSA" with "Piper"
- **Certification Reset**: Fixed certification dropdown not resetting aircraft hours to 0 when "None" is selected
- **FAA Lookup UX**: Replaced system alerts with inline status messages that auto-hide after 4 seconds
- **FAA Lookup Availability**: Checkbox automatically detects if tail-lookup API is available; disables and greys out with informational message when FAA lookup is not enabled in deployment
